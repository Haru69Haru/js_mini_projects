# ðŸ§  JavaScript Mini Projects

Welcome to my **JavaScript Mini Projects Collection**!  
This repository contains a series of small projects I created while learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Each project focuses on improving core programming skills such as DOM manipulation, events, logic building, and user interaction.
